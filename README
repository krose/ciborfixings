## CIBOR Fixings

I have downloaded the daily files with fixings from Finansraadet.dk
and made a tidy version of the CIBOR fixings from 2005-04-01 to 2011-04-01.

I have also made the code for downloading the data available, but I
have not put a lot of energy into documenting and explaining each step. If
you run the code you will create and download a lot of files, so make sure
that you save them into a separate directory.

The code can easily be modified to download other files from Finansraadet.

The fixings before 2005-04-01 is downloaded but discarded in the process as the
fixings have a slightly different structure. You can use just a bit of energy if you want to and include the data back to 2004.

The fixings after 2011-04-01 is downloaded but discarded in the process as
the xls file format is to old (!?) and the standard Excel parser in R can't
handle these files and I didn't want to use to much time on this.
